        "You work for a global retail company that operates in various regions around the world, including the Australia and Oceania region. The company stores sales data in a CSV file named \"sales.csv,\" which contains information about sales and profits in different countries. You are tasked with developing a program to analyze sales data stored in a CSV file named \"sales.csv\" for countries within the Australia and Oceania region. The program should calculate the maximum, minimum, and average profit for **countries** in this region and create a bar graph displaying the total profit for each country. This visualization aims to provide insights into the financial performance of countries in the Australia and Oceania region, helping your global retail company make informed decisions."
